Sample Report Event Project - Non-Working Sample
--------

Over the last two years, I have contributed twice to rails/rails, but most of
my outside work in coding has been about training with Team Treehouse and
CodeSchool, and there weren't projects built through that training. My time in
that training and in my code-writing at my place of employment has been
super-valuable, but it doesn't leave much time for outside coding projects. With
that in mind, I am attempting to illustrate some of the tasks/projects I
accomplished at work--without posting proprietary code. So, this code won't work.
I'm not creating a working app here. Just the key components that show anyone who
might review this repo the sort of things I have built.

A project like this one recalculated information to change the sorting of a major
component on a public-facing website. Once that code was built, it was implemented
to the satisfaction of the ops folks.

Because this is non-working code, and many required elements (that I have not
written) are absent. For example, there is a reference to LuluCat/lulucat in this
code. While I DO have a cat named Lulu, there is no service named Lulu. That name
is a placeholder for an application (in the working code) that used SQL to access
the database for large queries. Part of the application I primarily worked in
would process the raw data from that application, process, and translate that data
to JSON for an outside service. That JSON connector is also absent from this code,
but in a working version, it would exist. :-)
